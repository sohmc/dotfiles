# .dotfiles

Dotfiles installed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), maintained in Github.

Most files were saved in a private repo for some time but figured it was time for me to join the rest of the world and publish my dotfiles.

# Installing

[Installation instructions are available on the official website](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/#one-line-binary-install) but this is how I like to install it:

```console
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- -b $HOME/.local/bin init --apply sohmc
```
